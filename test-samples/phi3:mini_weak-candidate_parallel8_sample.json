          "reasoning": "Alex Johnson has only one year of experience as a product manager which falls significantly short compared to the requirement for five years' experience in similar roles. The scope and responsibility growth mentioned do not align with that expected at this director level within Elovate."

          "score": 2,
          "reasoning": "Without any mention of system design or architectural experience, Alex Johnson's resume does not demonstrate the technical depth needed for understanding and contributing meaningfully to complex systems. This candidate seems unfamiliar with modern development practices that are crucial in your role."

          "score": 3,
          "reasoning": "While there is no direct evidence of problem-solving ability, the absence of technical depth and architectural understanding makes it difficult to evaluate this skill.

          "score": 3,
