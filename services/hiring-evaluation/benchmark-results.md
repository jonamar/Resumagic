# Hiring Evaluation Benchmark Results

## Testing Methodology
- 3 test candidates: Weak (1-2yr exp), Average (4-5yr exp), Strong (12yr exp)  
- Measuring: Speed, Score Distribution, Feedback Quality
- Baseline: Sequential processing, original rubric
- Test 1: Parallel processing + enhanced rubric

## Test 1: Parallel Processing + Enhanced Rubric
**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Changes**: 
- Parallel evaluation of 6 personas
- Enhanced scoring rubric (1-3=Reject, 4-5=Weak, 6-7=Solid, 8-9=Strong, 10=Exceptional)
- Calibration guidance: "Most candidates score 4-7"

### Results:

#### Weak Candidate (Alex Johnson - 1-2yr exp)
**Status**: In Progress (timeout at 2min)
**Partial Results Observed**:
- Design: 3-6 scores (good discrimination)
- Technical: 4-5 scores (appropriate for weak candidate)
- Finance: 4-6 scores (realistic assessment)
**Feedback Quality**: ✅ Specific gaps identified ("lacks direct experience with financial planning")
**Speed**: ❌ Still >2min (timeout)

#### Average Candidate
**Status**: Pending

#### Strong Candidate  
**Status**: Pending

## Analysis
**Score Distribution**: ✅ Improved - seeing realistic 4-6 scores instead of grade inflation
**Feedback Quality**: ✅ Specific, actionable feedback vs generic praise  
**Speed**: ⚠️ Single persona = 35s, Parallel = still ~3.5min due to Ollama limits

### Speed Breakdown
- Single HR persona: 35s (much better than expected 60s)
- With 6 personas in parallel: Still limited by Ollama processing capacity
- **Root cause**: Even with parallel requests, Ollama processes them slower than our target

### Quality Improvements Confirmed
- Weak candidate scores: 4-6 (realistic for 1yr experience vs 8-10yr requirement)
- Specific feedback: "lacks technical discipline", "1 year vs required 8-10 years"
- No more grade inflation

## Next Steps
- Test prompt compression (current: 9,758 chars per persona)
- Consider --fast flag with smaller model
- Investigate if shorter prompts maintain quality
