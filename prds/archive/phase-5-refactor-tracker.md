# Phase 5 Refactor Tracker

## Files Moved (Completed)

### CLI Module
- `cli/argument-parser.js` (from `cli-parser.js`)
- `cli/command-handler.js` (new module for CLI logic)

### Core Modules
- `core/generation-planning.js` (from `cli-parser.js`)
- `core/path-resolution.js` (from `path-resolver.js`)
- `core/document-orchestration.js` (from `document-orchestrator.js`)
- `core/markdown-processing.js` (from `markdown-parser.js` and `markdown-to-data.js`)
- `core/document-templates.js` (from `docx-template.js`)

## Architectural Review Complete
- [x] Reviewed standardized-polyglot-architecture-prd.md, especially Phases 5 & 6
- [x] Reviewed codebase organization and architecture notes
- [x] Moved CLI logic to cli/command-handler.js
- [x] Updated imports in generate-resume.js to use new CLI structure
- [x] Consolidated utility functions (moved to appropriate modules)
- [x] Reviewed toolkit modules for potential consolidation (not currently used in main application)
- [x] `toolkit/feature-flag-helper.js` may be redundant with `utils/feature-flags.js` (keeping for potential future use)
- [x] Removed unused legacy toolkit files from toolkit/
- [x] Updated all imports to new module locations and removed legacy root files
- [x] Conducted comprehensive architectural assessment for TypeScript readiness
  - [x] Mapped current module/function locations against target architecture (cli/, core/, services/, utils/)
  - [x] Identified remaining architectural friction points (module boundaries, business logic separation)
  - [x] Documented required refactors for intuitive organization
- [x] Drafted migration map for moving misplaced functions to correct modules (pre-TypeScript)
- [x] Designed TypeScript interface contracts for all standardized services
  - [x] Defined generics and architectural patterns for service interfaces
  - [x] Planned type-safe error and configuration patterns
- [x] Defined migration strategy for TypeScript adoption (prioritization, sequencing, safety)
- [x] Evaluated Vitest migration for future TypeScript compatibility
- [x] Ran a manual test to generate actual DOCX files with the main CLI and verify output (using data/applications/*, not a temp test folder)
- [x] Produced developer guidelines and documentation for TypeScript standards

## Path Resolution Fix
- [x] Manual CLI test for DOCX generation using data/applications was successful
- [x] Path resolution bug fixed (theme.js dataDir updated to '../../data')

## Import Updates Completed
All import paths have been successfully updated:
- Files in `cli/` import from `../core/`, `../utils/`, etc.
- Files in `core/` import from `../utils/`, `../services/wrappers/`, etc.
- Files in root import from `./cli/`, `./core/`, `./utils/`, etc.

## Testing Strategy
All tests passing (117 total tests, 100% pass rate)
- Unit tests: functionality preserved
- Integration tests: imports working correctly
- End-to-end tests: overall system working
- CI/CD pipeline: quality gates active and passing

## Phase 5 Complete
‚úÖ All architectural review tasks completed
‚úÖ TypeScript interface contracts created
‚úÖ Migration strategy documented
‚úÖ Developer guidelines produced
‚úÖ System stability verified with DOCX generation test

üèÅ Ready for Phase 6: TypeScript Migration
