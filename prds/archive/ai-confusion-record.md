this is a record of times when the ai agent has made a wrong assumption about how things are architecected, where files should be placed, or what the expected behavior is. all are just copy and pasted from the ai agent's responses across various tasks.  

1. 

⏺ Bash(cd ../app && ./scripts/ci/pre-commit.sh)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):1: no such file or directory: ./scripts/ci/pre-commit.sh

⏺ List(../app/scripts)
  ⎿  Listed 13 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Bash(cd ../app && find . -name "*pre-commit*" -type f)
  ⎿  ./.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample
     ./.git/hooks/pre-commit

⏺ Read(.git/hooks/pre-commit)
  ⎿  Read 3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The hook is pointing to ../scripts/ci/pre-commit.sh but that file doesn't
  exist. Let me check if it's in the parent directory:

⏺ List(../scripts)
  ⎿  Listed 9 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Found it! The pre-commit script is in the root /scripts/ci/ directory. Let me
   run it:

⏺ Bash(cd ../app && ../scripts/ci/pre-commit.sh)
