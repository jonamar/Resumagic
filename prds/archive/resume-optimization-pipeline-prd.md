# Resume Optimization Pipeline PRD

## Overview
Build an automated pipeline that takes a master resume and job posting, then generates an optimized resume tailored to that specific job opportunity.

## Problem Statement
Job seekers need to customize their resumes for each application to match job requirements and pass ATS systems, but manual customization is time-consuming and inconsistent.

## Solution
An automated system that intelligently optimizes resume content by analyzing job postings and strategically incorporating relevant keywords and priorities while maintaining the resume's structure and authenticity.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Input Collection
- **Master Resume**: User's comprehensive resume (PDF/DOCX/structured data)
- **Job Posting**: Job description text or URL

### 2. Job Analysis Engine
- Extract keywords from job posting
- Identify priority skills and requirements
- Analyze job level, industry context, and key qualifications
- Rank keywords by importance/frequency

### 3. Resume Optimization Engine
- **Content Matching**: Map user's experience to job priorities
- **Strategic Keyword Integration**: Insert relevant keywords naturally into existing content
- **Within-Section Reordering**: Reorder bullet points within job descriptions and summary paragraphs to emphasize relevant experience
- **Summary Adjustment**: Modify professional summary to align with role requirements
- **Maintain Structure**: Preserve fixed section order and chronological job ordering

### 4. Export & Delivery
- Generate optimized resume in original format (PDF/DOCX)
- Maintain professional formatting and readability
- Ensure natural language flow

## Technical Specifications

### Input Requirements
- Master resume in common formats (PDF, DOCX, or structured JSON)
- Job posting as text or URL
- Support for various job board formats

### Processing Constraints
- **Fixed Structure**: Do not reorder resume sections or job chronology
- **Within-Section Flexibility**: Only reorder content within individual job descriptions or summary paragraphs
- **Keyword Density**: Maintain natural language - avoid keyword stuffing
- **Content Preservation**: Keep all original information, only enhance and reorder

### Output Requirements
- Same format as input resume
- Professional formatting maintained
- File naming convention: `[original-name]_optimized_[job-title]_[date]`

## Success Metrics
- Resume optimization completion rate
- Keyword integration accuracy
- Content readability score maintenance
- User satisfaction with optimized output

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Cover letter generation
- Application submission automation
- Resume creation from scratch
- Multi-format template system

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on content optimization rather than visual redesign
- Prioritize accuracy and natural language over keyword density
- Maintain user's original voice and style
- Ensure output passes basic ATS readability tests

## Future Considerations
- Integration with job board APIs
- A/B testing for optimization strategies
- Machine learning for improved keyword prioritization
- Cover letter generation using same optimization logic
