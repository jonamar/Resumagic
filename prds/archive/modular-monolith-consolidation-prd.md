# Modular Monolith Consolidation PRD

## Executive Summary

Transform the current hodgepodge pseudo-microservices architecture into a clean, well-structured modular monolith with consistent internal APIs, unified error handling, and single-language runtime.

## Problem Statement

The current app/services architecture exhibits characteristics of a **modular monolith with service-oriented aspirations** rather than true microservices:

- **Inconsistent service boundaries**: Mixed JavaScript and Python services with different integration patterns
- **Monolithic orchestration**: Central coordinators (`document-orchestrator.js`, `generate-resume.js`) manage all services
- **Mixed integration patterns**: File system operations, HTTP calls, and shell execution for service communication
- **Inconsistent error handling**: Each service handles failures differently despite centralized error handling work
- **Pseudo-independence**: Services depend on shared file system state rather than true isolation

## Solution Overview

Consolidate into a clean modular monolith that embraces the monolithic approach while maintaining clear service boundaries and consistent patterns.

## Success Criteria

- **Single Runtime Environment**: All services running in unified language/runtime
- **Consistent Internal APIs**: Standardized service contracts and communication patterns
- **Unified Error Handling**: Centralized error taxonomy and handling across all modules
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear domain boundaries with hexagonal/clean architecture patterns
- **Single Deployment Pipeline**: Simplified deployment and operational overhead
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unified testing framework with integration test coverage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Service Interface Standardization (2-3 weeks)

**Objectives:**
- Define consistent internal API contracts
- Standardize error handling across all modules
- Create unified configuration management
- Implement dependency injection container

**Deliverables:**
- Service interface specifications
- Unified error handling implementation (building on existing work)
- Configuration management system
- Dependency injection framework

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All services expose consistent API interfaces
- Error handling follows unified taxonomy and patterns
- Configuration is centralized and environment-aware
- Services can be injected and tested in isolation

### Phase 2: Language Consolidation (3-4 weeks)

**Objectives:**
- Migrate Python services to Node.js (recommended) OR vice versa
- Standardize on single runtime environment
- Create shared utility libraries
- Unify testing frameworks

**Deliverables:**
- Migrated keyword-analysis service to JavaScript
- Shared utility libraries for common functionality
- Unified testing framework (Jest for JS or pytest for Python)
- Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single language/runtime across entire application
- All services use shared utility libraries
- Unified test runner and reporting
- Performance maintains or improves current benchmarks

### Phase 3: Clean Architecture Implementation (2-3 weeks)

**Objectives:**
- Implement hexagonal/clean architecture patterns
- Create clear domain boundaries
- Separate business logic from infrastructure
- Add comprehensive integration tests

**Deliverables:**
- Refactored codebase following clean architecture principles
- Domain layer with clear business logic separation
- Infrastructure layer abstraction
- Comprehensive integration test suite

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Business logic is independent of external dependencies
- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Integration tests cover all major workflows
- Code follows consistent architectural patterns

### Phase 4: Performance & Deployment Optimization (1-2 weeks)

**Objectives:**
- Single deployment pipeline
- Optimize for monolithic performance
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Add comprehensive monitoring

**Deliverables:**
- Streamlined deployment pipeline
- Performance optimization implementation
- Feature flag system
- Monitoring and observability setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single deployment process for entire application
- Performance meets or exceeds current benchmarks
- Feature flags enable safe rollouts
- Comprehensive monitoring covers all critical paths

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js (recommended for existing JS infrastructure)
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Centralized ErrorHandler class (building on existing work)
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and metrics collection

### Service Modules
1. **Keyword Extraction Service**: Job posting analysis and keyword extraction
2. **Keyword Analysis Service**: Keyword ranking, categorization, and optimization
3. **Hiring Evaluation Service**: Multi-persona candidate evaluation
4. **Document Generation Service**: Resume, cover letter, and combined document creation
5. **Path Resolution Service**: File system operations and path management

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Development Complexity**: Simpler than microservices approach
- **Operational Overhead**: Single deployment reduces complexity
- **Team Coordination**: Builds on existing team knowledge

### Medium Risk
- **Language Migration**: Python to JavaScript conversion requires careful testing
- **Performance Impact**: Ensure no regression during consolidation
- **Feature Parity**: Maintain all existing functionality during migration

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Migration**: Migrate services one at a time with thorough testing
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baselines and monitor throughout migration
- **Feature Flags**: Enable safe rollbacks if issues arise
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain high test coverage throughout process

## Timeline & Resources

**Total Duration**: 8-12 weeks
**Resource Requirements**: 1-2 developers focused on architecture work
**Dependencies**: Completion of existing error handling consolidation (Phase 1 already complete)

### Milestones
- **Week 3**: Service interfaces standardized
- **Week 7**: Language consolidation complete
- **Week 10**: Clean architecture implementation complete
- **Week 12**: Performance optimization and deployment ready

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Consistent patterns across all modules
- **Performance**: No regression in processing times
- **Maintainability**: Reduced complexity in service interactions
- **Deployment**: Single deployment pipeline with <5 minute deploy times
- **Testing**: >90% test coverage with integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Unified error taxonomy with consistent user experience

## Future Considerations

This modular monolith approach provides a solid foundation that can evolve:
- **Microservices Migration**: Clear service boundaries enable future extraction if needed
- **Scaling**: Can identify bottlenecks and extract specific services later
- **Team Growth**: Well-defined modules support team organization as organization scales

## Conclusion

The modular monolith consolidation aligns with the current team size, domain characteristics, and existing infrastructure while providing a clean, maintainable architecture that can evolve with business needs.
