there a few misc issues that need to be addressed:


1. FIXED: many of the services still have legacy code that needs to be removed

for example in the Hiring Evaluation service:
    executeLegacyEvaluation()
    -> The older implementation approach
    executeStandardizedEvaluation()
    -> The newer implementation approach

there is no need for legacy code here. we should complete the migration to the new approach and remove the legacy code.


2. FIXED: test-phase4-validation.js 

that sounds like code that needs to be cleaned up. is there more like this?
