# Phase 5: Architectural Review & TypeScript Strategy PRD

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation plan for Phase 5 of the standardized polyglot architecture initiative: conducting a comprehensive architectural review and preparing for TypeScript migration. The core value of TypeScript is only unlocked when it is well-architected with clear module boundaries and intuitive organization.

Building on the successful standardization of service interfaces (JSON-in/JSON-out contracts), this phase focuses on reorganizing the codebase to establish clear separation of concerns before migrating to TypeScript, ensuring maximum benefit from type safety.

## Product Vision & Priorities

### Core Product Values
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience
- **Intuitive Organization**: Clear module boundaries that match developer expectations
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured code that's easy to understand and modify
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced IDE support, agentic coders support, and refactoring capabilities

### Target Developer Experience
**Primary Users**: AI coding agents (Claude, Qwen3-Coder, GPT, etc.)
**Secondary Users**: Human developers onboarding to the system

**Key Experience Goals**:
- **Clear Module Boundaries**: Functions located where developers intuitively expect them
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of service interfaces and data structures
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better autocompletion and refactoring capabilities
- **Fast Feedback**: Rapid development cycles with type checking

## Problem Statement

### Current State Analysis

After examining the codebase in detail, the following structure exists:

```
app/
├── cli-parser.js              # Contains both parsing AND business logic (determineGenerationPlan)
├── path-resolver.js           # Path resolution functions (some should be in core/)
├── generate-resume.js         # CLI entry point with embedded logic
├── document-orchestrator.js   # Core orchestration logic (good but mixed with implementation)
├── services/wrappers/         # Clean service layer with standardized JSON contracts (good)
├── utils/                     # Utilities including error handling (well-structured)
└── toolkit/                   # Additional utilities (golden master validator, etc.)
```

### Current Pain Points

1. **Business Logic Placement**: `determineGenerationPlan` function is misplaced in `cli-parser.js` rather than in a core business logic module
2. **Unclear Module Boundaries**: No clear separation between CLI, business logic, and service layers
3. **Mixed Concerns**: Single files handling multiple unrelated responsibilities
4. **Organic Growth Pattern**: Code placed by implementation convenience rather than logical organization

### Impact on TypeScript Migration

- **Reduced Type Safety Benefits**: Without clear module boundaries, TypeScript's value is diminished
- **Increased Migration Complexity**: Mixed concerns make incremental migration more difficult
- **Poor Developer Experience**: Functions in unexpected locations hinder IDE support
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Unclear boundaries make refactoring harder

## Solution Overview

**Intuitive Organization + TypeScript**: Reorganize codebase into clear module boundaries before TypeScript migration to maximize type safety benefits.

### Architectural Philosophy
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between CLI, core business logic, services, and utilities
- **Intuitive Organization**: Functions located where developers expect them
- **Type-First Design**: Architecture designed to leverage TypeScript's strengths
- **Incremental Migration**: Safe, step-by-step approach preserving functionality

## Success Criteria

### Developer Experience Metrics
- **Clear Module Structure**: Intuitive `cli/`, `core/`, `services/`, `utils/` organization
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing across all interfaces and data structures
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Improved autocompletion and refactoring capabilities
- **Fast Feedback**: <5 second type checking during development

### Technical Performance Metrics
- **No Performance Regression**: Maintain or improve current processing times
- **Migration Completeness**: 100% of JavaScript files converted to TypeScript
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain existing 124+ tests with TypeScript compatibility
- **Development Velocity**: <5 minute setup for new AI agents
